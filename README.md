Lanthaneum is a new experimental coin based on the modified Cryptonote PoW algorithm called SoftCrypton.

Lanthaneum was designed as a light alternative to current Cryptonote-based coins.
It should be mineable even with low-end PCs, including phones and tablets.
Blockchain size and network load plan to stay at reasonable level as well.
Transfer's tiny flat fee is another key point of Lanthaneum for everyday use.
